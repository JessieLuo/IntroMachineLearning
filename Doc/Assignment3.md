# Assignment 3: PCA, K-means and Kernel Methods

## Description

The above data is a sub-sampled version of the MNIST dataset. It contains images for 10 digits (10 classes). The dataset contains 6,000 samples. The images from the data set have the size 28 x 28. They are saved in the cv data files. Every line of these files consists of an image, i.e. 785 numbers between 0 and 1. The first number of each line is the label, i.e. the digit which is depicted in the image. The following 784 numbers are the pixels of the 28 Ã— 28 image.

## Question 1

Perform PCA on the dataset to reduce each sample into a 10-dimensional feature vector.

Show the covariance matrix of the transformed data.

## Question 2

Perform k-means clustering to cluster the dataset (without applying PCA) into 10 groups.

## Question 3

Please plot the loss curve, that is, the change of loss value of the k-means algorithm with respect to the number of iterations

## Question 4

Please use the first 4000 samples as the training set and remaining 2000 samples as the validation set, and design a way to choose the best k in k-means algorithm.

## Question 5

Please implement kernel k-means algorithm with RBF-kernel, that is,

$k(X_i,X_j)=exp(\frac{-||x_i-x_j||^2_2}{2\sigma^2})$.

The hyper-parameter can be empirically set to

$2\sigma^2=\frac{1}{N^2}\sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{j=1}^N||x_i-x_j||^2_2$

Please only use the first 500 samples and cluster them into 5 groups. This is for reducing the running time of your code.

TIPS: If you can use matrix operations to replace summations, your code will be more efficient. However, this is just optional.
